  - **Selected Users:** Restricted to invited collaborators.
  - **Private:** Accessible only to the creator.

### **Encrypted Notes**

- Encrypted notes are protected with a password **different from the account password**.
- The password is stored temporarily in **sessionStorage** (not in server or local storage).
- Notes are encrypted and decrypted on the user's device using **AES-256 encryption**.
- Encrypted notes can be shared but require the same password for access. Passwords must be shared manually.

### **Data Security**

- All data is transmitted securely over **TLS/HTTPS**.
- Server stores:
  - **Standard notes:** Stored as plaintext but secured with optional password protection.
  - **Encrypted notes:** Stored in fully encrypted form (zero-knowledge).
- Passwords for notes are hashed using secure algorithms like **Argon2** or **PBKDF2**.
